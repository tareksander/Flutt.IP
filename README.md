# Flutt.IP

A cross-platform Stud.IP app build with Flutter.

TODO: German README.md

## Roadmap

See [TODO.md](TODO.md).


## Features



## Required API routes

The app requires the new JSONAPI introduced in Stud.IP 4.5, though some API features are only introduced in later versions.  
It is able to gracefully disable functionality based on unavailable API routes, but for the best experience you should have all enabled.  
For using the app for administration purposes, you have to set the `JSONAPI_DANGEROUS_ROUTES_ALLOWED` Stud.IP configuration entry to enable some admin routes, like deleting users.
